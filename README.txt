Assignment Summary:

In this project, we analyzed the acceptance rate of coupons for Bar and Coffee house.

For the Bar coupon, we found that the dominating factor is whether the driver has a habit of going to bar or not. There are other factors such as age, occupation and whether if a kid is with the driver or not, which has some possitive influence on the coupon acceptance rate, but they are small and insignificant.

For the Coffee house data, the initial acceptance rate is 50%. We found that several factors will highly influence the coupon acceptance rate. The time of the day between 10am to 2pm are more favorable, also the proximity of the driver to the coffee shop is also have positive impact. From the driver statistics, a younger age driver or a studdent tend to more likely to accept the coupon. Like the bar data, it is also more likely for driver who has a habit going to coffee shop to accept the coupon. If we target drivers with these characteristics, we can potentially increase the acceptance rate to 88%.
